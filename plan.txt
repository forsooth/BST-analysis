Geometric Representation of a Binary Seach Tree

Generic Binary Search Tree API

The API will include the following functionallity:

    new_operation()
        - Begins an operation:
          - sets the current node to the root
          - records the begining of a new operation
    remove_subtrees()
        - Returns a 2 new BSTs that contains the right and left subtrees
    add()
        - Creates a node in the tree if the current node is "empty"
        - It is an error to call when the current node is non-empty
    remove()
        - removes the current node iff the node has 0 or 1 children
        - It is an error to call remove on a node which has two children
        - Note: Decided against preforming a full typical BST remove as
          diffrent algorithms modify the tree in significanly differing ways.
          Splay Tree deletion for instance splays the node to delete to the
          top and deletes the root and joins the two sub trees
